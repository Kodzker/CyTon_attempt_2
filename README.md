# CyTon_attempt_2
second attempt to make a new programming language


Not everyone will love this programming tool ! But I'll do it anyway .

For those who liked the idea , I will give more examples of how the language will work after its implementation .

I want more and more people to come and help create this programming tool .


If something doesn't work out , that's not a problem, because you learn from mistakes . I start writing this interpreter on the second try , good luck to us :-)
